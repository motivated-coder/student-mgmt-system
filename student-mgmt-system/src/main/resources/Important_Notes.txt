-----Hibernate related-----
Reference - https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-data-sql-and-schema-sql

Please note that script-based initialization
i.e. through schema.sql and data.sql and Hibernate initialization together can cause some issues.
Either we disable Hibernate automatic schema creation:

 spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none

This will ensure that script-based initialization is performed using schema.sql and data.sql directly.

If we still want to have both Hibernate automatic schema generation in conjugation with script-based
schema creation and data population, we'll have to use:

  spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true

This will ensure, that after Hibernate schema creation is performed then additionally schema.sql is read
for any additional schema changes and data.sql is executed to populate the database.

Also, script-based initialization is performed by default only for embedded databases, to always initialize
a database using scripts, we'll have to use:

spring.sql.init.mode=always
